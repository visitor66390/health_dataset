It is airborne and lingers for over 2 hours in a space. This is essentially a weapon that cannot be detected.

Based upon the consensus of studies, the Covid shot provides increased immunity for 5-12 weeks.  After this initial period, there is some evidence that viral resistance actually drops below pre-shot levels.  The shot does appear to blunt the worst of our immune systems over-reaction to a new virus, but is nowhere near as effective as actually having and surviving an actual infection.  This is why they are now recommending a booster every 5 months.
